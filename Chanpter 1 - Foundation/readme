 In Chapter 1 I'll show how mathematical functions can be represented as a series of operations linked together to form a computational graph, and show how this representation lets us compute the derivatives of these functions' outputs with respect to their inputs using the chain rule from calculus. At the end of this chapter, I'll introduce a very important operation, the matrix multiplication, and show how it can fit into a mathematical function represented in this way while still allowing us to compute the derivatives we'll end up needing for deep learning.
